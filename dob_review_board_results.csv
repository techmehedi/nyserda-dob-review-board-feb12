**General Construction**

Reasoning:

The description outlines a renovation project involving interior work (new partitions, doors, flooring, and cosmetic work) and replacement of a concrete stair. Although it involves some structural changes (replacing the concrete stair), the overall scope of the project appears to be a renovation rather than a new construction or specialized system installation. The lack of significant changes to the building's structure, use, egress, or occupancy supports this classification.",,

Filing this Alt.1 application to change in egress and occupancy from Retail to Ambulatory Diagnostic or Treatment Health Care Facility under Zoning use Group 6,,,NO,0,0,General Construction,"Based on the job description, I would classify the user's job as: **General Construction**","Based on the job description, I would classify it into the category: **General Construction**

Reasoning:
The request to change egress and occupancy from Retail to Ambulatory Diagnostic or Treatment Health Care Facility under Zoning use Group 6 suggests potential work involving modifications to the existing structure and site to accommodate a new use. This falls under the category of General Construction, as it involves altering the existing structure to meet the requirements of a new healthcare facility.

Additional Advice from other agents:
One agent solution: **Support of Excavation**

**Reasoning:**

The request to change egress and occupancy suggests potential work involving excavation (for new entrances, pathways, etc.) and altering the existing structure to accommodate a new use. This falls under the category of supporting excavation as it involves modifying the site and building to meet the requirements of a new healthcare facility.

However, upon closer analysis, this application relates to a **change in zoning use and occupancy classification**, which is more aligned with **General Construction** or **Foundation** if it involves structural or site modifications. But since no excavation, foundation, or structural work is explicitly mentioned, and it's focused on egress and occupancy, the most accurate classification is:

**General Construction**

The description mentions a ""VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL EXTENSION"" and a conversion to a ""two family dwelling unit"", which suggests a significant renovation or addition to an existing building. The involvement of a ""C of O"" (certificate of occupancy) also indicates that the project involves a substantial construction or renovation effort, which aligns with the General Construction category.

Additionally, the description of the project involves work on the foundation and structure of the building, which are critical components of the project.
